Wikipedia Travel

What and why?

In terms of software, what I'm thinking of doing is making the wikipedia game be a bit easier to start. If you don't know what the wikipedia game is, you start at one wikipedia page, and the goal is to get to a totally unrelated wikipedia page only using the links provided in the wiki. For example, starting at chocolate cake and ending at the fall of the roman empire. As for the why, I can think of two reasons. One, it's a fun way to entertain yourself and a group of friends if you have nothing else to do. And two, it could be used to learning new things you didn't know.

For whom?

This software is for those people who want to learn more about anything, or those people who are looking to stay entertained while waiting for a bus, or for class to start. It is mostly for college students who don't know how to procrastinate with their time and must find a way to distract themselves if they are intersted in playing

How?

A description of what the system will do from an end-user's perspective. Be as complete as necessary to fully explain the system, but do not worry about technical implementation - this will be developed in subsequent work.

What I am picturing right now is having two options at first. The learning mode or the competitive mode. The learning mode will be very casual. The website gives both the beginning and end point. After clicking the starting point, the user may take as much or little time as possible learning any information they feel like learning until they move on. At the end, the website will hopefully record what articles they clicked to get to the last article. The competitive mode is a bit similar, although this time ther is no learning. Everything will be timed, so there will be no time for sitting around reading. If you do get to the last article, then you are awarded browny points which can be redeemed at your local cake factory for nothing in return. In the competitive mode there should be difficulties. The harder the diffculty the longer the path and the less timeyou get. At the end, the website should display teh articles the user went through and if they succeeded or failed. If they ducceeded then the website gives them a congratulations, but if they fail then the website should find the most creative and inoffensive mocks and insults to throw at the user to encourage them to beat the website. 

Scope

For the front end, it could be as simple as just showing the starting website link and the name of the ending article, or have it look more fancy which can look like anything. As for the backend, this could prove to be a lot. The website firstly has to have information on a lot of wikipedia articles, their names, and all of the links. It also needs to keep track of the amount of articles the user clicked, and which one's exactly. Generating the starting article to the ending article in the competitive mode is very subjective. What indicates that getting from one article to another is easy or hard? Figuring that out and coding it could prove difficult. That is all I have for now, I am not very creative when it comes to these kinds of things, so I am looking forward to seeing what better ideas are out there.
